# Sleep Disorder Prediction

## Project Overview
This project aims to analyze sleep health and lifestyle patterns to predict sleep disorders. The main objective is to preprocess data, explore relationships between various predictive variables, and build classification models to predict sleep disorders.

## Key Steps
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaned and prepared the data for analysis.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Analyzed patterns and relationships in the dataset.
3. **Modeling**: Applied multiple classification methods to predict sleep disorders, including:
   - Logistic Regression
   - Support Vector Classifier (SVC)
   - Random Forest Classifier

## Results
The Random Forest model achieved the highest accuracy of **89%** in predicting sleep disorders, demonstrating its effectiveness for this problem.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn (for visualization)
